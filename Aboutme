Hi, I'm Ray V and I travel around the world and write smart codes

I was born in India , raised in states and living in canada, I always dreamed that a hurricane would take me somewhere to another country. And once I really ended up in another country - in states, studying at a IT school. There I began to travel a lot around Asia in my free time and then moved to work in California.

I discovered the world of low-cost airlines and began to fly somewhere and see the world every weekend. Being somewhere in the 15th country, I realized that I had enough experience and knowledge to share with others - and so this blog appeared. Here you will find useful tips, my travel experiences, life hacks and the usual daily thoughts about everything that surrounds me.
